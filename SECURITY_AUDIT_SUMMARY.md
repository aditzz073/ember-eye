## 🚀 Security Infrastructure Deployed

### Automated Security Tools
- **npm audit** - Frontend vulnerability scanning
- **pip-audit** - Backend vulnerability scanning  
- **CI/CD integration** - Automated checks on every commit
- **Pre-deployment validation** - Security gates before releases

### Available Commands
```bash
# Run comprehensive security audit
npm run audit

# Frontend-only security check
npm run audit:frontend

# Backend-only security check  
npm run audit:backend
```

### CI/CD Integration
Security audits are now part of the GitHub Actions workflow:
- ✅ Runs automatically on push/PR
- ✅ Fails builds if vulnerabilities found
- ✅ Provides detailed vulnerability reports
- ✅ Ensures secure deployments

## 🔄 Ongoing Security Maintenance

### Automated Monitoring
- GitHub Actions runs security audits on every commit
- Dependabot can be enabled for automatic dependency updates
- Security alerts will be caught early in the development cycle

### Manual Checks
Run security audits before major releases:
```bash
npm run audit
```

### Recommended Schedule
- **Daily**: Automated via CI/CD
- **Weekly**: Manual audit review  
- **Monthly**: Dependency update review
- **Quarterly**: Full security assessment
