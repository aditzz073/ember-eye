# Production Optimization Guide

## Frontend Bundle Optimization

### Current Bundle Analysis
- Bundle size is currently >500KB, which can be optimized
- Main contributors are likely large dependencies like leaflet, framer-motion

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Code Splitting**
   - Implement lazy loading for routes
   - Split heavy components into separate chunks

2. **Bundle Analysis**
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev rollup-plugin-visualizer
   npm run build
   npm run analyze # Will show bundle composition
   ```

3. **Dependency Optimization**
   - Consider lighter alternatives to heavy libraries
   - Tree shake unused code
   - Use dynamic imports for heavy components

## Backend Performance Optimization

### Model Loading
- Pre-load model on startup instead of per-request
- Implement model caching
- Consider model quantization for smaller size

### API Optimization
- Implement response caching
- Add request rate limiting
- Optimize database queries

## Production Monitoring

### Frontend Monitoring
- Add error tracking (Sentry)
- Performance monitoring (Web Vitals)
- User analytics

### Backend Monitoring
- Health check endpoints
- Logging aggregation
- Performance metrics
- Database monitoring

## Security Hardening

### Frontend Security
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- HTTPS enforcement
- Secure headers

### Backend Security
- Input validation
- Rate limiting
- CORS configuration
- Environment variable security

## Deployment Optimization

### Build Optimization
- Production builds with optimized assets
- Environment-specific configurations
- Automated testing and validation

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated testing
- Security scanning
- Performance testing
- Deployment automation
